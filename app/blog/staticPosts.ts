    content: `## Native Medicine Garden Price and Flower Tier Guide

Native Medicine Garden makes flower shopping easier by organizing the menu into clear tiers. Start with the tier that matches the kind of flower you want, then choose the weight that fits your budget and visit.

The simple idea is: pick the grade, compare the weight, and use the live menu before you head in. Larger weights usually improve unit value, so both the total price and the price per gram are worth checking.

## Start With A Tier

Use these tier pages when you want to compare the menu directly:

- [Exotic flower](/exotic): a top-shelf lane for shoppers who want the highest tier first.
- [Premium flower](/premium): a strong middle-to-top lane for shoppers balancing quality and value.
- [AAA+ flower](/aaa): a simple quality lane with easy weight comparisons.
- [AA flower](/aa): a value-focused lane for straightforward everyday browsing.
- [Budget flower](/budget): the clearest low-cost lane when price is the main priority.

Once the tier feels right, the live menu helps shoppers compare the current strains and weights inside that tier.

## How The Weight Ladder Helps Value

Moving up in weight usually improves the unit value. That means the shopper can look beyond the total price and see how the price per gram changes as the amount gets larger.

Current tier examples commonly shown across the store menu include:

- Exotic flower: 1g at $20/g; 3g at $40, about $13.33/g; 6g at $60, about $10/g.
- Premium flower: 1g at $15/g; 3g at $30, about $10/g; 6g at $45, about $7.50/g.
- AAA+ flower: 1g at $10/g; 3g at $20, about $6.67/g; 6g at $30, about $5/g.
- AA flower: a simple value tier around $4/g where listed on the menu.
- Budget flower: a low-cost lane around $3/g or $10/3g where listed on the menu.

That structure keeps the buying path easy: choose the grade, choose the weight, and compare the unit value before visiting.

## Match The Visit To The Budget

If the goal is the smallest spend, start with the smaller weight options. If you already know the tier you like, compare the next weight step and see how much the unit value improves. If you want a stronger flower lane, stay in Premium or Exotic and compare from there.

This is why a tiered menu works well for local storefront shopping. It keeps the decision organized, makes value easier to understand, and gives shoppers better questions to ask staff when they visit.

## Use The Live Menu Before Visiting

For the smoothest visit, open the Native Medicine Garden menu before heading out. The live menu is the best place to compare current flower tiers, weights, and store-specific options. The store page is also useful for directions, contact details, and visit planning.

If you are comparing flower tiers in Toronto, use this page as the simple guide, then use the live menu for the current selection.

## Helpful Next Steps

- Compare [Exotic flower](/exotic), [Premium flower](/premium), [AAA+ flower](/aaa), [AA flower](/aa), and [Budget flower](/budget).
- Open the Native Medicine Garden store page for directions, contact details, and visit planning.
- Use the blog index for more store-specific guides.

## FAQ

### How do I choose the right flower tier?

Start with the grade that fits the visit, then compare the weight options inside that tier. This makes it easier to balance quality, amount, and budget.

### Why does unit value matter?

Unit value shows the approximate price per gram at different weights. It helps shoppers see how value changes as they move from 1g to larger options like 3g or 6g.

### Why link to each tier page?

Each tier page gives shoppers a faster path to the exact flower lane they want instead of forcing everyone through the full menu first.

### Where should shoppers check current strains?

Use the live menu for current store-specific selection, then use the store page for directions, contact details, and visit planning.`,
